Scientific outreach is an essential part of being a geoscientist, which is why I have been working with CU Science Discovery to educate K-12 students on geology! A few weeks ago in early March 2022, I spent a day teaching 1st and 2nd graders at Blue Mountain Elementary School in Longmont, CO. In the presentation to the students, I discussed how the Earth is constantly changing, cool facts about rocks like that there are mountain ranges underneath the oceans, and worked on skills like pattern recognition and organization using bags of rocks.
