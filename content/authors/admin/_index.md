My research focuses on understanding the chemical and physical evolution of continental and oceanic lithosphere over different periods of Earth history. In particular, I am interested in interpreting geophysical data sets, especially seismic wave speed and heat flow, in terms of geochemical and geological processes using interdisciplinary methods like thermodynamic modelling.
