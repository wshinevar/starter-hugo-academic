abstract: Gravity, magnetic, and bathymetry data collected along a continuous
  1,400-km-long spreading-parallel flow line across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
  indicate significant tectonic and magmatic fluctuations in the formation of
  oceanic crust over a range of time scales. The transect spans from 28 Ma on
  the African Plate to 74 Ma on the North American plate, crossing the
  Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 35.8°N. Gravity-derived crustal thicknesses vary from
  3–9 km with a standard deviation of 1.0 km. Spectral analysis of bathymetry
  and residual mantle Bouguer anomaly show a diffuse power at >1 Myr and
  concurrent peaks at 390, 550, and 950 kyr. Large-scale (>10 km) mantle thermal
  and compositional heterogeneities, variations in upper mantle flow, and
  detachment faulting likely generate the >1 Myr diffuse power. The 550- and
  950-kyr peaks may reflect the presence of magma solitons and/or regularly
  spaced ~7.7 and 13.3 km short-wavelength mantle compositional heterogeneities.
  The 390-kyr spectral peak corresponds to the characteristic spacing of faults
  along the flow line. Fault spacing also varies over longer periods (>10 Myr),
  which we interpret as reflecting long-lived changes in the fraction of
  tectonically versus magmatically accommodated extensional strain. A newly
  discovered off-axis oceanic core complex (Kafka Dome) found at 8 Ma on the
  African plate further suggests extended time periods of tectonically-dominated
  plate separation. Fault spacing negatively correlates with gravity-derived
  crustal thickness, supporting a strong link between magma input and fault
  style at mid-ocean ridges.
