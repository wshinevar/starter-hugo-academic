abstract: The Gore Mountain Garnet Amphibolite (GMGA), part of the
  Mesoproterozoic Grenville Province in the Adirondack Highlands, NY, USA, is an
  iconic rock type known for hosting the world’s largest garnets (up to 1 m
  diameter). We present a new detailed petrographic study of these rocks. Field
  relations, whole-rock, and mineral major and trace element chemistry suggest
  that these rocks formed via a prograde hydration reaction of a metagabbro
  during an increase in pressure and temperature. Laser ablation inductively
  coupled plasma mass spectrometry U–Pb geochronology applied to zircon
  interpreted to be metamorphic in origin dates this reaction to 1053·9 ± 5·4 Ma
  (2σ; MSWD = 0·94), during the Ottawan Orogeny (1090–1020 Ma). Our results on
  peak metamorphic P–T conditions based on thermobarometry, diffusion models,
  and thermodynamic modelling indicate that these rocks formed at
  ultrahigh-temperature (>900 °C) conditions (P = 9–10 kbar, T = 950 ± 40 °C),
  significantly hotter than previously estimated. Diffusion models pinned by
  nearby cooling ages require the GMGA to initially cool quickly (9·1 °C Ma–1),
  followed by slower cooling (2·6 °C Ma–1). The two-stage cooling history for
  the GMGA could reflect initial advection-dominated cooling followed by
  conduction-dominated cooling once flow ceases. Our results suggest that the
  region was hot enough to undergo topography-driven lower crustal flow similar
  to that hypothesized for modern Tibet for 20–0 Ma (25–0 Ma when the effects of
  melt are included).
