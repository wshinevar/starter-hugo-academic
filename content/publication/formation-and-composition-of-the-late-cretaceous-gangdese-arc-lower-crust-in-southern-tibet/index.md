abstract: Arc lower crust plays a critical role in processing mantle-derived
  basaltic melts into the intermediate continental crust, yet can only be
  studied indirectly or in exposed arc sections. Compared with the relatively
  well-studied oceanic arc sections (e.g., Kohistan and Talkeetna), the
  composition and formation mechanisms of continental arc lower crust remain
  less clear. Here we present a geochronological and geochemical study on the
  Lilong Complex and the Wolong granitoids from the Gangdese arc deep crustal
  section in southern Tibet. The Lilong Complex is composed of the early (85–95
  Ma) mafic-intermediate sequence and late (85–86 Ma) ultramafic sequence. The
  Lilong crustal section exposed crustal depth extending from ~ 42 to 17 km
  based on the geobarometry. The mafic-intermediate sequence is a damp (low H2O)
  igneous differentiation sequence characterized by the subsequent appearance of
  pyroxene → plagioclase → amphibole → biotite. The ultramafic sequence
  represents a wet igneous differentiation sequence composed of
  olivine → pyroxene → amphibole → plagioclase. The 74–84 Ma Wolong granitoids
  were formed by fractional crystallization of wet magma and intra-crustal
  assimilation. Calculated seismic properties of the Gangdese deep arc crust are
  comparable to the average continental crust at a similar depth. The average
  composition of the Gangdese arc lower crust is basaltic andesite with SiO2 of
  ~ 54 wt%. The highly incompatible elements in the Gangdese arc lower crust are
  systematically higher than those of the oceanic arc and are comparable with
  the estimates of lower continental crust, suggesting continental arc magmatism
  significantly contributes to the formation of continental crust.
