abstract: The continental lithospheric mantle plays an essential role in
  stabilizing continents over long geological time scales. Quantifying spatial
  variations in thermal and compositional properties of the mantle lithosphere
  is crucial to understanding its formation and its impact on continental
  stability; however, our understanding of these variations remains limited.
  Here we apply the Whole-rock Interpretive Seismic Toolbox For Ultramafic
  Lithologies (WISTFUL) to estimate thermal, compositional, and density
  variations in the continental mantle beneath the contiguous United States from
  MITPS_20, a joint body and surface wave tomographic inversion for Vp and Vs
  with high resolution in the shallow mantle (60–100 km). Our analysis shows
  lateral variations in temperature beneath the continental United States of up
  to 800–900 °C at 60, 80, and 100 km depth. East of the Rocky Mountains, the
  mantle lithosphere is generally cold (350–850 °C at 60 km), with higher
  temperatures (up to 1000 °C at 60 km) along the Atlantic coastal margin. By
  contrast, the mantle lithosphere west of the Rocky Mountains is hot (typically
  >1000 °C at 60 km, >1200 °C at 80–100 km), with the highest temperatures
  beneath Holocene volcanoes. In agreement with previous work, we find that the
  chemical depletion predicted by WISTFUL does not fully offset the density
  difference due to temperature. Extending our results using Rayleigh-Taylor
  instability analysis, implies the lithosphere below the United States could be
  undergoing oscillatory convection, in which cooling, densification, and
  sinking of a chemically buoyant layer alternates with reheating and rising of
  that layer.
