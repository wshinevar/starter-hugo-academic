abstract: "We calculate the viscosity structure of the lower continental crust
  as a function of its bulk composition using multiphase mixing theory. We use
  the Gibbs free-energy minimization routine Perple_X to calculate mineral
  assemblages for different crustal compositions under pressure and temperature
  conditions appropriate for the lower continental crust. The effective
  aggregate viscosities are then calculated using a rheologic mixing model and
  flow laws for the major crust-forming minerals. We investigate the viscosity
  of two lower crustal compositions: (i) basaltic (53 wt % SiO2) and (ii)
  andesitic (64 wt % SiO2). The andesitic model predicts aggregate viscosities
  similar to feldspar and approximately 1 order of magnitude greater than that
  of wet quartz. The viscosity range calculated for the andesitic crustal
  composition (particularly when hydrous phases are stable) is most similar to
  independent estimates of lower crust viscosity in actively deforming regions
  based on postglacial isostatic rebound, postseismic relaxation, and paleolake
  shoreline deflection."
