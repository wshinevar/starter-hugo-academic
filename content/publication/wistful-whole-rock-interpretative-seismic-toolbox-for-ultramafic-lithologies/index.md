abstract: "To quantitatively convert upper mantle seismic wave speeds measured
  into temperature, density, composition, and corresponding and uncertainty, we
  introduce the Whole-rock Interpretative Seismic Toolbox For Ultramafic
  Lithologies (WISTFUL). WISTFUL is underpinned by a database of 4,485
  ultramafic whole-rock compositions, their calculated mineral modes, elastic
  moduli, and seismic wave speeds over a range of pressure (P) and temperature
  (T) (P = 0.5–6 GPa, T = 200–1,600°C) using the Gibbs free energy minimization
  routine Perple_X. These data are interpreted with a toolbox of MATLAB®
  functions, scripts, and three general user interfaces: WISTFUL_relations,
  which plots relationships between calculated parameters and/or composition;
  WISTFUL_geotherms, which calculates seismic wave speeds along geotherms; and
  WISTFUL_inversion, which inverts seismic wave speeds for best-fit temperature,
  composition, and density. To evaluate our methodology and quantify the forward
  calculation error, we estimate two dominant sources of uncertainty: (a) the
  predicted mineral modes and compositions, and (b) the elastic properties and
  mixing equations. To constrain the first source of uncertainty, we compiled
  122 well-studied ultramafic xenoliths with known whole-rock compositions,
  mineral modes, and estimated P-T conditions. We compared the observed mineral
  modes with modes predicted using five different thermodynamic solid solution
  models. The Holland et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egy048)
  solution models best reproduce phase assemblages (∼12 vol. % phase
  root-mean-square error [RMSE]) and estimated wave speeds. To assess the second
  source of uncertainty, we compared wave speed measurements of 40 ultramafic
  rocks with calculated wave speeds, finding excellent agreement (Vp RMSE = 0.11
  km/s). WISTFUL easily analyzes seismic datasets, integrates into modeling, and
  acts as an educational tool."
